-- Normal is in the most readable colors: black on white background.
-- as in many language there is no such thing as 'normal' (but in markdown,
-- in which i write a lot, most of text is Normal), it seems
-- preferable to me if at least one other group has these colors.
-- i think that Variable/Identifier or Function are a good option.

-- function could have long names, just as variables, so it's seems better
-- to gave them a dark readable color.

-- As comments has a status different from all other syntax groups, it
-- is the only one which is italic. as they are often used as a
-- 'deactivated' mechanism, grey seems to be meaningfull: between code
-- (foreground) and non-code (background).

-- Statement seems to be pretty short, and it is good if it is very
-- different from other groups such as variable and functions.
-- yellow seems to be a good option, then. plus, i don't see anything 
-- (appart from interface and comments) that could be yellow, because it 
-- makes long names unreadable.

-- operator in red, same reasons as for yellow.

-- in my writing practice, strings are very commons, and can be very 
-- longs. and i need to read it (for example, i use it also for 
-- highlighting quotes in markdown, so i need a very readable color, once
-- again.

-- string is a subtype of constant, so it's seems good if both have 
-- near colors (turquoise / green seems near).

-- other things in pink/magenta (different tones},

-- INTERFACE
-- cursor must be very visible, yellow seems good (or pink?},
    -- i dislike backgrounding the cursor line, so i highlight instead the 
    -- CursorLineNr, so i quickly see where the cursor is.

    -- the rest of the interface should be discrete, i think grey 
    -- is a good thing. so i put grey for anything else.
    --
    -- for Pmenu (especially if it spams very often), a light background.
    -- 255 is a light grey. good for backgrounds.

    -- i don't use that much LineNr (i jump using Leap.vim), so lineNr 
    -- doesn't need to be visible.

    -- folding white so there is no horizontal bars. i think that the 
    -- dotted line is enough.

    -- NonText give no usefull information: nearly invisible.



    -- but ModeMsg give usefull informations, grey too but more visible.

    -- discrete sign column (gr},



    -- StatusLine (if not LuaLine or something) is simple and discrete too.



    -- Errors must be very visible.



    -- all others diagnostic should not be too visible.


    -- FileType specifics

    -- no function in markdown, so i use it for code and codeBlock.
